# JJReactPoker

Poker single-player game developed in React JS (with hooks). I dveloped this project just to test my ability with React Hooks. It is my first project with this ... technology (?) and the goal was to see how much of the time spent on the project was for normal development tasks and how much for solving doubts about how React Hooks work.
As background information, I recently passed many basic React JS tests (the first one gave me a certificate in just 3 minutes) but failed to pass a quite exigent React JS 16.8++ test. 

The result of my experiment can be resumed in these metrics:

- The full time spent developing the whole project (including selection of additional material, web design, development of game logic, learning game rules, etc) was about 6 days (48 hours)
- The time spent looking for information on how to do something was about 7 hours
- The time spent looking how to do something in react was about 2 hours. Yep, even finding ways to do something in CSS was more a problem than my supposed lack of experience in React JS 16.8++.

Conclusions: Conclusions are quite evident.

## Project specifications

A single-player Poker game. Just play against three automated opponents and try to get all their money. If you do, you win.
The AI is just 99% random logic but the result is playable and in my opinion the playing experience is not much different from playing online against unexperienced players. I intend to improve the AI in future versions.

The game logic is almost the same as in any Holdem Texas game but some small details have been simplified as the goal was just to test my ability to develop a Poker interface and not so much developing the logic. Anyway I think it could be a quite solid base for developing a more advanced version of a poker game.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
